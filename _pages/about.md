My name is Weiyong Xu (徐卫勇 in Chinese). I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Psychology, University of Jyväskylä. I am currently working on the Academy of Finland Postdoc project ["The reorganization of memory representations during rest and sleep"](https://akareport.aka.fi/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=x_hakkuvaus2&CLICKED_ON=&HAKNRO1=348989&UILANG=en){:target="\_blank"}.

In 2020, I completed my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Jyväskylä, advised by Prof. [Jarmo Hämäläinen](https://www.jyu.fi/fi/henkilot/jarmo-hamalainen){:target="\_blank"}. My doctoral [dissertation](https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/71016){:target="\_blank"} was about brain activity changes related to learning of audiovisual associations in reading. I mainly used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain process of audiovisual integration in learning to read. I also worked as an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) in the European Innovative Training Network (ETN) project [ChildBrain](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/641652){:target="\_blank"} (2015-2019), the goal of which was to advance brain research on the children’s developmental neurocognitive disorders.

Before starting my PhD in Finland, I received my Master’s and Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. My Master’s thesis was about functional connectivity and complex network analysis of the aging brain using Electroencephalography (EEG).
